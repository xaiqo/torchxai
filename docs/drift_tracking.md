## Explanation Drift Tracking

Goals
- Compare explanations across model versions and data distributions
- Detect interpretability drift quantitatively and visually

Methods
- Distance measures: cosine, correlation, Wasserstein between attribution maps
- Stability across seeds/augmentations; cohort-based comparisons
- Report table: per-class/per-cohort drift indices, trend lines

Artifacts
- JSON/Markdown reports; diff heatmaps; side-by-side dashboards
